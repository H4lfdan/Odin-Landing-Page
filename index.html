        <p><em>"This is a song about how when sometimes you find it necessary to rob the safe at the restaraunt where
            you work, and it's funny 'cause your friends who like have good jobs say 'What good can come of that?'
            ", here I quote your friends: "They only have about two thousand dollars in there." 
            If you were honest with your friends, you would say 'Look, two thousand dollars will buy me a 
            quarter pound of peanut butter crank. And I'll be going for a good ten days off that, 
            unless I meet up with some friends.' Then you may stop to think to yourself that you're likely
            to meet up with some friends. New friends. People you didn't really know until word begain to spread 
            in the neighborhood, 'John robbed the safe! And he took all 2k, and he bought a quarter pound!
            He's in room 10, 253 North Broadway, you can't miss it! It faces Broadway at an angle across from
            the colosseum' and so, so there you are with your new friends, listening to King Diamond, as you do, 
            high for three days and beginning to talk nonsense and you may think to yourself 'I wish I had a 
            song to sing', you may only hold this song for a second or so. But I heard you when you thought 
            that, and that's why I wrote you this song."</em></p>
